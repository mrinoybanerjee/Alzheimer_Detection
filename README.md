# Alzheimer_Detection ðŸ§ 
Leveraging MRI scans to detect Alzheimer's disease using CNN and vision transformers, aimed at enhancing diagnostic accuracy and supporting early intervention.

The app is live here: https://detect-alzheimer.streamlit.app/

## Introduction
This repository contains a deep learning framework designed to detect Alzheimer's disease using MRI scan images. The project aims to assist radiologists and medical professionals in early diagnosis through automated image analysis.

## Project Description
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder where early diagnosis is pivotal yet challenging. MRI scans are vital for detecting cerebral structural changes indicative of Alzheimer's. This project utilizes advanced deep learning architectures, including CNN based ResNet-50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers, which are trained, validated, and tested on a dataset of MRI scans to discern intricate patterns linked to the disease.

This project consists of two main parts:

PyTorch Modeling: Jupyter notebooks that contain the modeling work using PyTorch, including the creation, training, and validation of a CNN model, EfficientNet model and vision transformer for alzheimer's disease detection.
Streamlit App: The model was deployed on streamlit and is available for use.
